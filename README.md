# @phosphor-icons/core

This repository hosts the raw SVGs and catalog data – including tags, categories, and release versions – of all icons in the [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com) family. It serves as the basis for our fuzzy-search on our website and other tools, and as a dev dependency in the build process in some of our framework-specific libraries. You may find this package is useful to you in implementing a port of Phosphor to your preferred framework, or as a source of truth for our current SVG assets.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @phosphor-icons/core
```

## Assets

This package exposes all icons as SVG assets, grouped by weight, under the `/assets` directory (i.e.  `/assets/<weight>/<kebab-name>-<weight>.svg`). These files can be used as needed for custom implementations or ports. Your framework and build tooling may require custom type declarations to recognize and transform `"*.svg"` files into modules.

> *Note for Vite users:* As of Vite 4.0.4 (current at the time of writing), a bug in one of its dependencies prevents wildcard exports from being resolved. This will be [fixed](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/00a79ec88472cbcc767c1187f919ce372215f573) in Vite 4.1.

### Example

```ts
import ghostDuotone from "@phosphor-icons/core/duotone/ghost-duotone.svg";
```

Using [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/docs/webpack/#use-with-url-loader-or-file-loader) (includes `create-react-app` projects):

```tsx
import { ReactComponent as GhostDuotone } from "@phosphor-icons/core/duotone/ghost-duotone.svg";
```

## Catalog

This package exposes a named export `icons`, which is an array of `IconEntry` objects represententing each icon, its name in both `kebab-case` and `PascalCase`, the catergories and tags associated with it, as well as the version it was published in and the most recent version it was updated in:

```ts
interface IconEntry {
  name: string;               // "cloud-lightning"
  pascal_name: string;        // "CloudLightning"
  categories: IconCategory[]; // ["weather"]
  tags: string[];             // ["*updated*", "meteorology", "cloudy", "overcast", "stormy", "thunderstorm"]
  published_in: number;       // 1.0
  updated_in: number;         // 1.4
}
```
